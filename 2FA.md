I used 2 factor authentication in many different aspects of my life, such as when I login to Wright state, My banking app, and many different gaming sites.
With 2 factor authentication I need have an app that generates a number on that I have to enter in to be able to login or be called by a automated service that verifys my last 4 social digits or account number.

I just set up 2 factor authentication on my discord account and it required me to download an authenticator app and either manually enter in the code to pair or scan the UR code to pair.
To log into my discord I now have an 6 digit number that is on an authenicator app that refreshes every minute that I have to enter into the discord app to verify.


If I was king for a day and I got to choose how everyone uses 2 factor authentication, I would use an authenticator app that was on a sperate device. I believe that having this authenticator app on a sperate devices
adds an extra layer of security by not centralizing where you login and store your authentication apps. Authenication apps do have disadvantages such as if you lose your device
that has your authentication app and can't access that app or may take time and energy to install on another device.( I just read recently from https://www.androidcentral.com/definitive-ranking-two-factor-authentication-methods ) 
With ease of use comes risks when 2 factor authentication is used!
